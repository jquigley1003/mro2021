          <p class="ion-text-left">Many customers depend on engine maintenance facility shops to work in 
            their best interest, but often this does not go as expected, leaving 
            customers faced with a situation where they do not feel they are getting 
            what they expected at the agreed upon price. Resolving these types of 
            situations is what I excel at and where my decades of process knowledge 
            and technical and business experience will work to your benefit. Please 
            allow me to step in as your “Turbine Engine Advocate” to manage the 
            situation and get your engine back on track and on budget.</p>

          <p class="ion-text-left">Some aftermarket engine maintenance companies are not directly affiliated 
            with or authorized by the engine manufacturer. Some companies outsource 
            warranty administration functions and may not work in the best interest of 
            their customers. Whatever the situation, I will work effectively with 
            engine manufacturer, manufacturer-authorized, or independent 
            engine-maintenance company to assure you receive fair warranty coverage.</p>

          <h1>Insurance Claim Negotiation Assistance</h1>
          <p class="ion-text-left">Insurance companies have claims adjusters on their payroll to mitigate 
            claims payout cost to their company. Most insurance adjusters handle both 
            airframe and engine for multiple manufacturers and are not experts on your 
            engine model. Please allow me to lend my experience to assure your best 
            interests are being looked after and assure your cost and downtime are 
            kept to a minimum.</p>
